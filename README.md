# Matrix_Determinant_Calculator_using_Gaussian_Elimination
This project demonstrates a program that calculates the determinant of a square matrix using the Gauss elimination method. It allows users to input their own matrices or use a predefined matrix example.The program performs the necessary operations to transform the matrix into upper triangular form and calculates the determinant based on the transformed matrix. The steps of the elimination process can be displayed for better understanding. The project serves as a practical implementation of linear algebra concepts and can be a helpful resource for learning and practicing matrix operations.
